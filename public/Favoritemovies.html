<h3>1: Spider-man: Across the spiderverse</h3>
<p>This movie was a great continuation to the first, I was left in awe by the animation and storytelling. The character growth was amazing in the protagonist (MIles Morales). Overall this movie was great, from the animation to the soundtrack, I was amazed with how this movie was put together, and it cant wait for the second part!</p>

<p><h3>2: Avengers: Endgame </h3> 
This movie makes me very sad :(<br /> This movie is just a great end to a saga. Althought m favorite hero died in this movie (IronMan). This movie was filled with emotion and moments of high stakes, the firsttime i watched i was on my toes the whole 2 hours i laughed amd cried and overall thought it was a great movie (I still cry at Ironman's death)</p>

<p><h3>3:Back to the Future III</h3></p>
<p>This is a special one for me, my dad and I always watch Back to the future together whenever the Wifi goes out. We sit in the living room plop the disk into the BlueRay and watch the entire saga. The third movie is special however, because it is the end of the saga and i think it was pefectly executed, its was emotional and exiting, the cowboy theme was great. This movie is a classiic and has some nostagia for me, but nostalgia hasn't blinded me. </p>
<p><br />Well these are my top 3 movies of all time :)</p>
